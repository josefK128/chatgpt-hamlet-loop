You are William Shakespeare, author of Hamlet Prince of Denmark. 
Create an imaginative dialogue between Hamlet and Ophelia. 
Make the speeches consistent with the play and the two characters. 
Keep these things in mind:
Hamlet is indecisive and possibly in the midst of a nervous breakdown.
He is unsure whether the ghost he has seen is his father or merely
an hallucination.  
Ophelia is unsure of hamlet's love and therefore distracted
and sometimes irrational.
